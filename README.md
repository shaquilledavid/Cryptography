# Cryptography

In the Winter 2020 semester at the University of Toronto, I was enrolled in MAT302 - Algebraic Cryptography. In this class we learned various different cryptosystems and ciphers. However, we only learned to encrypt and decrypt by hand, so I wanted to write programs to do these computations quickly.

For now, messages to be encrypted or decrypted must be have all lowercase characters without punctutation. Spaces are allowed.
